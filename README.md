This folder contains practical exercises and project files from my cybersecurity learning journey, focusing on Linux system administration and SQL database management.

Each project simulates real-world tasks such as analyzing login attempts, managing user accounts, auditing file permissions, and querying SQL databases. I use commands and tools in Linux (e.g., ls, chmod, etc.) and SQL (e.g., LIKE, AND/OR/NOT) to extract, manipulate, and secure critical system and database information.

ðŸ“Œ Skills Highlighted:

- Linux command-line proficiency

- SQL querying and data filtering

- System log analysis

- Incident detection and response

These exercises strengthen both my red and blue team capabilities by combining system-level operations with database analysis.
